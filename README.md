# Supply Chain Optimization Using Linear Programming

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to optimize supply chain costs using Python and linear programming. The goal is to determine the most cost-effective way to ship products from suppliers to warehouses while meeting supply and demand constraints.

## Problem Statement

A company needs to transport goods from suppliers to warehouses across regions. Each supplier has a limited capacity, and each warehouse has a fixed demand. Shipping costs vary between locations. The objective is to minimize total costs using a mathematical optimization model.

## Objective

Use Linear Programming (LP) to:
- Satisfy warehouse demands
- Respect supplier capacities
- Minimize the total transportation cost

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Google Colab
- `PuLP` – Linear programming library
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn` for visualization

## Methodology

1. Load and explore cost, demand, and supply data.
2. Formulate the LP model using decision variables.
3. Define the objective function and constraints.
4. Solve using the PuLP solver.
5. Visualize and interpret the optimized supply plan.

## Results and Insights

- Found the optimal transport plan from suppliers to warehouses.
- Minimized total shipping costs while fulfilling all business constraints.
- Visualized supply decisions through heatmaps and data summaries.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate inventory holding costs and lead times.
- Simulate real-world uncertainty (e.g., supplier delays).
- Apply model to dynamic supply-demand conditions.
